# sshspray

A multithreaded, queued SSH key and/or password spraying tool.

`sshspray.py` works against a list of hostnames, ip addresses, or CIDR subnet ranges.
You can specify either a keyfile, password, or both. If the keyfile is encrypted, you
can pass the passphrase on the command line, or you can wait to be prompted to enter
it securely. You may pass the password on the command line as well, or if you don't
provide a key or password, you will be prompted for a password.

One file for easy `wget`/`curl`

```
